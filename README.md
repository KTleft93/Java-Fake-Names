# Java-Fake-Names

Java Fake Names main code is found in directory by selecting mavenproject-->src--->test--->fakerDemo

Java and Maven Project which gives 1000 fake but realistic sounding names by utilizing Ruby's Faker Library
stores the names in a string array and then prints 1 name per line

Great to use for any project where you need multiple names but want to save time by not adding in names individually 

Add a File writer and write the names into a .txt or .csv file to suit your needs
